# Backend Coding Guidelines

> Scope: current conventions for implementing backend work in this repository.

## Stack summary

ASP.NET Core on .NET 10 with FastEndpoints, Mediator source generator request handling, EF Core for persistence, FluentValidation validators declared near endpoints, and xUnit v3 tests. The backend is split into `Web`, `UseCases`, `Domain`, and `Infrastructure`.

For build, run, and test commands from `src/ChangeMe.Backend` or from the repository root (`npm run build:backend`, `npm run test:backend`, and scoped scripts), see `AGENTS.md`.

## Layer ownership

### Web

- Owns application startup in `Program.cs`.
- Startup registrations and middleware for one concern should be grouped in `Web/Configurations/*Config.cs` extension methods rather than added inline in `Program.cs`.
- Owns HTTP endpoint declarations.
- Owns API-facing validation classes placed next to endpoint definitions.
- Owns endpoint base behavior: JWT auth defaults, `Result<T>` serialization, and HTTP status mapping through `Web/Common/` (`BaseEndpoint.cs`, `BaseEndpointWithoutRequest.cs`, `ResultHttpMapper.cs`, `HttpContextResultExtensions.cs`).

### UseCases

- Owns commands, queries, handlers, API DTOs, and feature-scoped orchestration services.
- Orchestrates domain operations and infrastructure dependencies.
- Should not duplicate domain invariants that already belong in aggregates.
- Keep only `*Command.cs` and `*Query.cs` files at the top level of each feature folder.
- Place feature DTOs under `UseCases/<Feature>/Dtos/`.
- Place shared handler helpers (messages, validation, mapping, light EF queries) under `UseCases/<Feature>/Utils/` as `*Utils.cs` static classes — mirror the frontend `utils/<feature>.utils.ts` convention.
- Place feature services under `UseCases/<Feature>/Services/` for orchestration with side effects (for example notifications).

### Domain

- Owns aggregates, entities, enums, interfaces, and business rules.
- Persisted domain types (including child entities and join rows) inherit `Entity` so `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `CreatedBy`, and `UpdatedBy` are set consistently via `ApplicationDbContext`.
- Should be the place for invariants like issue title/description constraints.

### Infrastructure

- Owns EF Core `ApplicationDbContext`, entity configuration, migrations, auth adapters, email service, and application service registrations.

## Standard path for a new endpoint

1. Add or extend the endpoint in `Web/<Feature>/`.
2. Add or update the validator in the same file if the request shape changes.
3. Add or update the command/query and handler in `UseCases/<Feature>/`.
4. Add or update feature DTOs in `UseCases/<Feature>/Dtos/` when the API contract changes.
5. Add or update feature services in `UseCases/<Feature>/Services/` when orchestration is shared.
6. Reuse or extend domain methods in `Domain/`.
7. Update EF configuration or migrations in `Infrastructure/` if persistence changes.
8. Add or update integration tests under `tests/...IntegrationTests/Endpoints/<Feature>/`.

## Endpoint conventions

Choose the endpoint base type by how the HTTP request is shaped:

| Shape                                                          | Base type                                                               | Example                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Body, query string, and/or route params bound to a request DTO | `BaseEndpoint<TRequest, TResponse>`                                     | `UpdateIssue`, `DeleteIssueAttachment`, `GetIssueAttachments` |
| No request payload (GET/POST/PUT with empty body)              | `BaseEndpointWithoutRequest<TRequest, TResponse>`                       | `GetMyAccount`, `Logout`, `MarkAllNotificationsAsRead`        |
| Multipart upload or other custom request handling              | `Endpoint<TRequest, Result<TResponse>>` + `HttpContext.SendResultAsync` | `UploadIssueAttachment`                                       |
| Binary stream or non-JSON response                             | `EndpointWithoutRequest` (custom `HandleAsync`)                         | `DownloadIssueAttachment`                                     |

Shared rules:

- Configure route, permissions, and summary in `ConfigureEndpoint()`.
- Let the base types handle `Result<T>` serialization and status codes; custom endpoints call `HttpContext.SendResultAsync` for JSON `Result<T>` responses.
- Validators stay close to the endpoint they protect (`Validator<TRequest>` in the same file). `BaseEndpoint` runs them automatically via FastEndpoints; custom endpoints must validate explicitly when needed.
- Use **parameterless** command/query records for no-payload endpoints — e.g. `record LogoutCommand() : ICommand<bool>`. Do **not** add dummy properties such as `doNothing` to satisfy binding.
- When an endpoint has **route parameters only** (no body), keep using `BaseEndpoint<TRequest, TResponse>` — FastEndpoints binds route segments to matching property names on the request DTO.
- When an endpoint has **no payload but needs route values** and you prefer `BaseEndpointWithoutRequest`, override `CreateRequest()` to read `Route<T>(...)`.

## Handler conventions

- Handlers live in the same file as their request contract in `UseCases/<Feature>/`.
- Return `Result<T>` consistently.
- Use `ApplicationDbContext` for persistence from the handler layer.
- After `SaveChangesAsync`, return API DTOs through an existing query via `mediator.Send` — do not instantiate query handlers with `new`.
- For create commands that return a resource body, wrap the query result in `Result.Created(dto, "/resource/{id}")` so `BaseEndpoint` responds with `201 Created`.
- For update or state-change commands that return the same details DTO, return the query `Result` directly (`200 OK`).

## Persistence conventions

- EF Core configuration lives under `Infrastructure/Persistence/Config`.
- Migrations live under `Infrastructure/Persistence/Migrations`.
- Database startup and migration behavior are configured through `Database` options and startup configuration.

### Unit of work

Infrastructure services (e.g. `UserAuthTokenService`) **stage** EF changes only — **no** `SaveChangesAsync`. The handler or feature orchestrator commits **once** per operation, after the full flow succeeds (including email send when a token must not outlive a failed delivery).

`IUserAuthTokenService`: `IssueTokenAsync`, `MarkTokenUsedAsync`, and `InvalidateUnusedTokensAsync` never save; `ValidateTokenAsync` and previews are read-only. Do not save in both the token service and the caller for the same change.

## Auth and cross-cutting concerns

- JWT configuration lives in `Web/Configurations/AuthConfig.cs` and environment settings.
- The notifications SignalR hub (push notifications only) and its DI registration should be configured through dedicated `Web/Configurations/*Config.cs` files, not inline in `Program.cs`.
- Endpoint auth defaults come from `BaseEndpoint` and `BaseEndpointWithoutRequest`.
- Email is abstracted behind `IEmailService`.

## Test expectations

- Endpoint behavior belongs in integration tests.
- Pure domain rules and utility behavior belong in unit tests.
- If you change route behavior, status code mapping, auth requirements, validation, or persistence side effects, add or update integration tests.

## Guardrails for AI agents

- Do not bypass the existing layered structure by placing domain logic directly in `Web`.
- Do not access the database directly from endpoint classes.
- Do not return ad hoc response envelopes; reuse the existing `Result<T>` flow.
- Before adding a new abstraction, inspect the closest feature in `Issues` or `Auth` and extend that pattern first.
- Infrastructure helpers stage EF changes; handlers/orchestrators own `SaveChangesAsync` (see **Unit of work** above).
